do not use 2 pins for direct/reverse motors, but an hardware inverse logic door
add a CAN to pixy camera !!!
remove spi for pixy
remove UART comm point
remove capacitor before "fin de courses"
not using PWM as enable in L293D
add pc5, remove invert direction to three engine and refresh pinmap
L293D 2 pin must go from "bras1_sens_direct" to PWM_bras1
L293D 7 pin must go from "bras1_sens_indirect" to direction_bras1
L293D 1 pin must go from "pwm_bras1" to 1. (exemple putting +5v from pin 16)
level shifters +3.3V -> +5V (pwm) are now unnecessary
make MUCH wider tracks for power supply(at least 0.42mm)
rename comments on board according to modifications
remove LM317 and R19(associated resistance)
remove mounting holes in schematcs
